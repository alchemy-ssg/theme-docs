Next.js and Gatsby are great for shipping React apps, and Jekyll for shipping Markdown apps.\n\nWhile building a huge Jekyll site (thousands of pages), I was dissapointed with the difficulty of customization and the lousy performance when building. This problem triggered me to build my own simple and fast generator.\n\nBuilt with node.js, markdown-it, and ejs, Alchemy allows for extremely simple content creation as well as rich templating support with layours and includes.\n\n","name":"/alchemy/site/posts/about.html","page_title":"About Alchemy","section_title":"But wait!
